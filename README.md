# Dexter - My current favorite character
## He is a killer at night 
### But works in te police - Homicide department during the day

**He has a sister who also works in the department.**


_She finds out about him in season 6 and helps him cover the murders._

**But unfortunately she dies in the last season. This** _affects Dexter very much and makes him commit suscide_




Here is the list of people most important to Dexter
- Debra (His sister)
- Harry Morgan (His father)

- Rita Morgan (His late wife)

## The Code

``` python
def judge_target(suspect):
    # Rule #1: Don't get caught
    if suspect.is_risky():
        return "Abort"

    # Rule #2: Never kill an innocent
    if suspect.proven_guilty == True and justice_system.failed == True:
        return "Tonight is the night"
    else:
        return "Bring donuts to the station"
```



Dexter uses `M-99` (etorphine hydrochloride) to instantly sedate his targets.
